\section{Procedures}

Procedures describe the actions that have to be taken in order to evaluate the
research problems defined in \autoref{sub:problems}.

These actions can separated into the three categories: Lab research, field
research, and statistical analysis.

\subsection{Lab Research}
\label{sub:lab_reserach}

A major goal of the lab research is to examine the \ms{} infrastructure
requirements listed in \autoref{sub:infrastructure}. The following table
illustrates how the instrumentation described in \autoref{sub:instrumentation}
is used to examine the infrastructure requirements. 

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ l | l | l | l | l | l | }
    &\textbf{Composition}&\textbf{Deployment}&\textbf{Persistence}&\textbf{Consistency}&\textbf{Monitoring}\\\hline

  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsection{Field Research}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

\subsection{Method Selection for Research Problems}

Based on the Infrastructure described in \autoref{sub:infrastructure} concrete
strategies can now be defined on how to investigate the subjects defined in
\autoref{sec:subject_pool}.

\subsubsection{}

For the examination of the subjects it is therefor necessary to access each
subject with in a specifically suited method. The research problems can be
summarized into four problem domains which allows to choose the the optimal
research method for each domain individually.

\subsubsection{Composition}
Expert Opinion on Model Approach

\subsubsection{Deployment}
Evaluation of 3rd party libraries (DevOps work)


\subsubsection{Development}
Expert Opinion

A one click solution for developers to start with online game
  	  development. The development process should feel as closely as possible to
  	  offline game development.

\subsubsection{Operations}
Play Tests
