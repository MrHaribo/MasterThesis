\section{Procedures}

The research methods used to examine the research problems explained in
\autoref{sub:problems} can be categorized into three areas: Literature
research, lab research, field research, and statistical analysis.

Each category provides a framework to enable research for one or more of the
more concrete research subject defined in \autoref{sec:subject_pool}. Table X
shows which research methods are used for each research subject.

\end{center}

The specific methods used in each category are derived from the design
science methodology principles\cite{wieringa2014design_science}.

\subsection{Literature Research}

Literature plays only a minor role in this thesis because the theoretical
foundation of this thesis has already been laid in the last two projects. None
the less literature is always consulted to give a theoretical backing to
findings of this thesis.\\

Especially in the topic of \ms{} infrastructure a deep study of the
documentation of composition engines and cloud service providers was necessary
to highlight advantages and differences.\\

To gain a sophisticated opinion about the \ms{} tenets several articles and blog
posts \todo{citation needed} are consulted to back findings about \ms{} with
opinions from the industry.\\

in regards to PCG the the book Procedural Content Generation In
Games\cite{shaker2014procedural} was studied in detail to identify PCG methods
which are usable for \ogs{}.

\subsection{Lab Research}
\label{sub:lab_reserach}

The majority of the research conducted during this thesis is lab research. This
is due to the very technical nature of the subject. 

The method used in lab research is the same for all research subjects namely
single-case experiments\cite{wieringa2014design_science}. Single-case
experiments examine one aspect of a problem domain under isolation.\\

Single-case experiments are conducted to examine all technical aspects of \mss{}
in regards to \ogs{} in a practical way. This includes the \ms{} infrastructure
requirements listed in \autoref{sub:infrastructure}, the deployment of \mss{}
and the challenges introduced by \mss{}.

All technical aspects can be examined on the basis of the instrumentation
artifact described in \autoref{sub:instrumentation}.

Table X shows which instrumentation artifact is used to examine each
technical aspects.

    \textbf{Source Control}&&x&&&\\\hline
    \textbf{Dedicated Server}&x&x&x&x&x\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Field Research}

To further back the findings gathered during the lab research field research is
conducted. But this is only possible to a limited extent because field research
is very preparation intensive. 

\subsubsection{Technical Action Research (TAR)}

Technical Action Research (TAR) allows to test a designed solution in a real
world context. This approach both gives the researcher a deep insight in the real
problem domain. A secondary result of TAR are usable concept or design that
can be used in commercial projects.

TAR has been conducted in this thesis in the form of a series of play-test based
on the MicroNet prototype and the Spacegame Prototype.

\subsubsection{Expert Opinion}

Expert opinion validation is used to verify the approach that is used to
develop \ogs{} with \mss{}. This is especially effective for the development
aspect of a \ms{} driven \og{}. The experts will be Students, Game Developers
and Software Developers.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

Since this thesis is mainly on exploratory basis the gathering of empirical data
has proven to be difficult. Especially the gathering of operational data from
field research is very cumbersome and also require a lot of effort to process
the data into a form that is usable for this report.

Because of this reason the statistical analysis will be limited to the
evaluation of the data gathered during expert opinion validation.
