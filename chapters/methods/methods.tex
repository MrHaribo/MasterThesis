\chapter{Methods}

This thesis is the third and final part of a three semester project. The
substance of the past two theses was to build a foundation for the incorporation
of \mss{} and \ogs{}. 

The first project thesis consisted of mostly literature research about the
topics \ogs{} and \mss{}. The result is a comprehensive documentation which
examines many aspects of both problem domains in detail. The practical part of
the first thesis was to develop a fully functional \ms{} networking solution
which suffices \og{} requirements.

In the second project thesis the theoretical foundation established in thesis
one was examined in practice by developing \og{} functionality on top of the
networking foundation. The result was a set of common \og{} features all
realized using \mss{}.

This third and final thesis is about the elaboration of the previous two theses
to bringing everything together and build a complete picture about \ms{} driven
\ogs{}. For this purpose the prototypes of the previous theses are refined and
put together by introducing the necessary glue, namely \ms{} composition and
deployment concepts.
