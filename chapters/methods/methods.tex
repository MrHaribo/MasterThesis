\chapter{Methods}

This thesis is the third and final part of a three semester project. The
substance of the past two theses was to build a foundation for the incorporation
of \mss{} and \ogs{}. 

The first project thesis consists of mostly literature about the topics \ogs{}
and \mss{}. The result is a comprehensive documentation of these two topics. The
essence of the document is the descriptions of a set of artifact that are
required to produce a fully functional \og{}.

During the second project thesis the theory established in thesis one was put
into practice. This was realized by implementing a prototype with the minimal
set of artifacts that are required to showcase the feasibility of \og{}
development with \mss{}. The results of the second project theses is a
feasibility study along with a fully functional prototype of an \og{} build
with \mss{}.

This third and final thesis is mainly about the elaboration of the previous tho
theses. This includes the examination of the open research problems listed in
\autoref{sub:problems} and the finalization of the prototype that was initially
developed during the second project thesis. This prototype serves as a reference
on how to develop and operate \ogs{} using a \mss{} environment.
