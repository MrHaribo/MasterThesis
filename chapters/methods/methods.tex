\chapter{Research Methods}

This thesis is the third and final part of a three semester project. The
substance of the past two theses was to build a foundation for the incorporation
of \mss{} and \ogs{}. 

The first project thesis \cite{biedermann2015project1} mostly consisted of a
literature research about the topics of \ogs{} and \mss{}. The result is a
comprehensive documentation which examines many aspects of both topics in
detail. The practical part of the first thesis was to develop a fully functional
\ms{} networking solution which suffices \og{} requirements.

In the second project thesis \cite{biedermann2016project2} the theoretical
foundation established in thesis one was examined in practice by developing
\og{} functionality on top of the networking foundation. The result was a set of
common \og{} features realized using \mss{}.

This third and final thesis is about the elaboration of the previous two theses
in order to bring everything together and build a complete picture about
\ms{} driven \ogs{}. For this purpose the prototypes of the previous theses have
been refined and put together by introducing the necessary glue, namely \ms{}
composition and deployment concepts.
