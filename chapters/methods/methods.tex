\chapter{Research Methods}

This thesis is the third and final part of a three semester project. The
substance of the past two theses was to build a foundation for the incorporation
of \mss{} and \ogs{}. 

The first project thesis \cite{biedermann2015project1} mostly consisted of a
literature research about the topics of \ogs{} and \mss{}. The result is a
comprehensive documentation which examines many aspects of both topics in
detail. The practical part of the first thesis was to develop a fully functional
\ms{} networking solution which suffices \og{} requirements.

In the second project thesis \cite{biedermann2016project2} the theoretical
foundation established in thesis one was examined in practice by developing
\og{} functionality on top of the networking foundation. The major focus during
thesis two was to examine what needs to happen inside \mss{} to realize \og{}
functionality while neglecting most external infrastructure aspects. The result
was a set of common \og{} features realized using \mss{}.

This third and final thesis examines how to build a coherent application with
a set of individual \mss{}. Especially composition and deployment
concepts are introduced as the necessary glue to bring a distributed application
together. In regards to composition, the orchestration and choreography concepts
are examined in detail and deployment is investigated by examining well known
containerization technologies.

An additional goal of thesis three is the elaboration of the previous two theses
to build a complete picture about \ms{} driven \ogs{}. This includes finalizing
the existing prototype and extend it with necessary features for composition and
deployment of \ms{} applications. The concepts developed in thesis three are
also validated through a user survey.

To give this thesis a scientific foundation \gls{dsm} principles are applied
whenever appropriate.
