\subsection{Testability}

The testing concept for \ms{} applications is can be easily integrated in the
Maven build process of the application. Since the services expose their API as
Java functions testing can bypass networking for testing. 

One problem with \ms{} testing is the access to the database. This can be solved
by using a containerized database that can be started before any tests are
executed.
