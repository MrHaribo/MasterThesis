\subsection{Test Concept}

The testing concept for \ms{} applications relies on the integrated tests
included in the Maven build process of the application. Since the services
expose their \gls{api} as Java functions testing can bypass networking for
testing. The handler functions are called directly in the test classes.

One problem with \ms{} testing is the access to the database. To spare the
developer with the need to implement a mock database a containerized
database that can be started before any tests are executed to imitate real
database behaviour.
