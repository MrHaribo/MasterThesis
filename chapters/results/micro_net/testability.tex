The testing concept for \ms{} applications relies on the integrated in the
Maven build process of the application. Since the services expose their API as
Java functions testing can bypass networking for testing. The handler functions
are called directly in the test classes.

One problem with \ms{} testing is the access to the database. To spare the
developer with the need to mock the database a containerized database that can
be started before any tests are executed.
