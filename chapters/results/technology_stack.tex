\section{Technology Stack}

The feature hypothesis (\autoref{sub:hypothesis}) states that networking,
persistence, serialization, session management and game engine integration are
necessary to build a fully functional \og{}. These essential features are
mandatory to drive an \og{}.

In addition to this core technology, supplementary technology is needed to help
fulfill the deployment and the simple development hypothesis
(\autoref{sub:hypothesis}). These technologies are: Container engine,
composition engine, continuous integration solution, source control system, and
interactive development environment (IDE).

The rest of this section describes each technology and states advantages and
disadvantages along with the arguments which are decisive for the composition
of the technology stack.

\subsection{Core Technologies}

The core technologies have mostly been defined in the prior two project thesis.
This section gives a short summary on the chosen technology.

\subsubsection{Networking}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/activemq}
    \end{minipage}& 
    ActiveMQ is a popular message broker. A message broker buffers messages
    and delivers them as soon as a receiver is available. This allows for a
    robust persistent messaging. Message brokers have been evaluated during
    project thesis one. ActiveMQ is the networking foundation of MicroNet and
    has proven to be very stable.
    
    PostgreSQL is available on Docker Hub as a Docker image and can therefore
	be integrated into a \ms{} application very easily using a composition engine.

\subsubsection{Persistence}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/PostgreSQL}
    \end{minipage}&
	PostgreSQL is a very mature open source relational database. It is available on
	all major platforms which allows for comfortable testing and deployment.
	Since version 9.2 PostgreSQL supports the json data-type. This makes it trivial
	to control the data flow from the network to the database.
	
	PostgreSQL is also available on Docker hub and therefore allows quick
	deployment. For production purposes a native installation of PostgreSQL is
	suggested to provide the needed stability as explained in
	\autoref{sub:database_solutions}.
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/couchbase}
    \end{minipage}&
    Couchbase is a NoSQL database realized as a Json document store. The Json
    affinity of Couchbase integrates very well in the technology stack.
    Couchbase has its own query language called N1QL which allows aggregated
    querries between multiple documents. Also access on sub-document level is
    possible to allow fine grained data access.
    
    Couchbase can run in a cluster and maintains a quorum on document to provide
    eventual consistency on writes which allows to scale the database system.
    Couchbase also provides timeouts of documents which can be used to imitate
    \textbf{session store} behaviour. This neglects the need for a distributed
    caching system like Redis for example. 
    
    Even if Couchbase exists as a Docker image it is advised to install
    Coutchbase native for production for the reasons explained in
    \autoref{sub:database_solutions}.

\subsubsection{Serialization}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/google-gson}
    \end{minipage}&
    Google Gson offers a very convenient out-of-the-box approach to serialize
    Java objects to Json strings and vice versa. An advantage of Gson is that
    also supports generic collections like hash-maps.
    
    The main advantage of Gson is it's simplicity. The simplicity goes to the
    cost of performance especially for the de-serialization of json strings.
    Because of this reason simpel Json serialization is only usable is the
    performance hit does not influence the application behaviour.

\subsubsection{Game Engine}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/Unity3D}
    \end{minipage}&
    
    Unity3D is very popular among independent developers because it has no
    initial financial barrier. Unity is very well documented and has a very
    healthy community to provide aid for development problems.
    
    Unity3D provides a rich editor that allows to prototype games quickly. It
    also offers a rich C\# API which allows to write any imaginable game logic. 
    
    For this thesis it is in particular interesting how well the combination of
    C\# game logic and Java back-end logic works in regards to the \ms{} tenet
    polyglot programming.

\subsection{Supplementary Technologies}

The supplementary technologies have been under intense evaluation during this
thesis. The result of this evaluation is a set of technologies which work well
together, are easy to learn and are open source or have a community edition.

\subsubsection{Container Engine}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/docker}
    \end{minipage}&
    Docker has already been mentioned several times during this thesis. The
    essence is that it all boils down to Docker being an enabler technology.
    This is because all other technologies support Docker in some way. This
    aspect makes the Docker Engine a reliable intermediate layer between the
    actual hardware and the application that is running. 
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

\subsubsection{Composition Engine}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/docker-compose}
    \end{minipage}&
    Docker compose is basically only a CLI application which translates a
    docker-compose file into a set of docker commands which are executed
    sequentially. The result is a containerized application running on a single
    host. Docker-compose is very helpful to quickly deploy a \ms{} application
    stack locally. The docker-compose format also provides the basis to deploy a
    composed application in the cloud using docker-swarm.
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/docker-swarm}
    \end{minipage}&
    Docker-swarm allows to run containerized applications on a cluster of docker
    machines. A docker machine is simply a host running a docker engine. Docker
    swarm allows to set up application stack purely with docker commands or by
    deploying a stack defined in a docker-compose file. Docker swarm offers
    multiple scheduling strategies which distribute the containers among the
    available docker machines.
    
    The major advantage of docker-swarm is its simplicity. The set of command
    needed to control the cluster is very limited and therefore very easy to
    understand. Also since it is the native Docker composition technology it is
    a natural match for Docker applications.
    
    One noticable disadvantage is the lack of several convenience features like
    a build-in dashboard or auto-scaling support. This is not a big concern
    since many third party dashboard tools like Grafana are available and
    auto-scaling can be added with a little implementation effort.

\subsubsection{Continuous Integration}

Continuous integration is generally a party of every software project and \og{}
are no exception. The continuous integration process is developed to the point
where a central build system like Jenkins can unify the whole build process
but this aspect is not covered in this thesis.


\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/maven}
    \end{minipage}&
	Maven provides a convenient way to define the build process of Java
	applications. For the game back-end services which are mainly written in Java
	this is a perfect match to define the build process.
	
	Maven also works very well in conjunction with Docker. The Maven Docker image
	allows for easily integrate the Java build process into the Docker build
	process by executing the Maven build inside the target container. This approach
	removes the need of any local java or Maven installation. 
	
	The drawback of the completely in-container Maven build is performance. Maven
	downloads ``the whole Internet'' within the container to build the application.
	This is not useful during development where short build times are mandatory. To
	cope with this problem the maven build can be conducted on the host system and
	only the binaries are send to the Docker daemon for the container build. This
	makes the build much faster and has no real disadvantage because the process
	can be reproduced exactly on the build system and therefor also speeds up
	automated builds.
	
	Maven is also very useful to preserve a consistent versioning of \mss{}. The
	game application stack can be described using a master .pom file containing
	current version of all services. The master .pom file can be updated to
	introduce new versions of any service. The continuous integration process can
	be triggered at this point to perform a rolling update with the currently
	deployed application stack.
	
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/github}
    \end{minipage}&
	Git is the \textbf{Source Control System} that builds the foundation for the
	version control. Git allows to share Maven projects which in turn allows to
	reproduce the build process locally but also on a build server. 
	
	Github is used to provide any needed dependency used for the build process.
	This includes the MicroNet framework.

\subsubsection{Interactive Development Environment (IDE)}

IDE is a wide term for a tool that simplifies the development process of a
software program. Usually it provides comprehensive tools that assist in writing
the source code of an application.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ c m{9cm} }
    \begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dependencies/eclipse}
    \end{minipage}&
	Eclipse provides a very solid foundation to develop Java projects. The plug-in
	development environment of Eclipse allows to customize the development to an
	arbitrary extent. This aspect is especially useful because in regards to \ms{}
	development no specific tools are available to conduct the whole development
	process of a \ms{} application from the IDE to the cloud.
	
	Also Eclipse provides a number of very useful plug-ins which further ease the
	\ms{} development process.
	
	The \textbf{Docker Tools} for Eclipse are a visual explorer  for Docker images
	and containers. It allows to quickly start, stop, build and remove containers
	without having to bother with the console.
	
	\textbf{Launch Groups} is a plug-in contributed by Eclipse CDT (C++ development
	plug-in for Eclipse). It is very useful to directly run or debug multiple
	applications at once. This allows to quickly bring up or terminate the whole
	application stack for testing purposes. Although CDT is required for Launch
	Groups it does not interfere with java development.
