\section{MicroNet}

MicroNet is a framework to develop and operate \ms{} applications. It is
designed to especially support rich \ogs{} but is not restricted to this
field. MicroNet also provides all the needed tools and examples to showcase how
to develop and operate an \og{}.

\subsection{Characteristics of MicroNet}

In order to reduce the complexity of an \og{} development a \ms{} approach can
be used by splitting the domain of a game into small shards that can be
independently developed. These shards are defined using \glsreset{ddd} \gls{ddd}
patterns, specifically the BoundedContext and the UbiquitousLanguage patterns
\cite{fowler2003-2016ddd}. The BoundedContext pattern is used to define the
boundaries of \mss{} according to game domain entities like players, items,
levels, or vehicles. The UbiquitousLanguage pattern then allows to make these
domain shards available in a terminology which is closely related to the game
domain. This is the general concept that defines the architecture of MicroNet
applications. In addition to the general concept MicroNet is designed according
to four guidelines to provide a lean and agile \og{} development process:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MicroNet does not reinvent the wheel for online game development but
  instead makes use of existing technologies, specifically of popular game
  engines.
  \item MicroNet tries to make the developer aware of the problems that are
  encountered during the development process as early as possible.
  \item MicroNet aims to help the developer to learn the process of \og{}
  development and to solve related problems.
  \item MicroNet supports the developers in realizing the especially
  difficult aspects of communication and consistency in a \ms{} application.
\end{itemize}
