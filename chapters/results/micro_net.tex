\section{MicroNet}

MicroNet is a framework to develop and operate \ms{} applications. It is
designed to be especially support rich \ogs{} but is not restricted to this
domain. MicroNet also provides all needed tools and examples to showcase how to
develop and operate an \og{}.

\subsection{Characteristics of MicroNet}

To reduce the complexity of an \og{} development a \ms{} approach can be used by
splitting the domain of a game game into small shards that can be developed
independently. These shards are defined using a \glsreset{ddd} \gls{ddd}
approach. This is the general concept behind MicroNet.\\

In addition to the general concept MicroNet is designed according to four
guidelines to provide a lean and agile \og{} development process:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MicroNet does not reinvent the wheel for online game development but
  instead makes use existing technologies, specifically popular game engines
  \item MicroNet tries to make the developer aware of the problems that are
  encountered during the development process as early as possible
  
  \item Using MicroNet aims to help the developer to learn the process of \og{}
  development and solve related problems
  \item MicroNet supports the developers in realizing the especially
  difficult aspects of communication and consistency in a \ms{} application
\end{itemize}
