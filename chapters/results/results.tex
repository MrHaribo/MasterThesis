\chapter{Results}

The primary demand on this thesis is that it delivers results which are
usable in practice and not only of theoretical nature. To make the results
practically relevant a lot of attention goes to the implementation of the
prototype which showcases the concepts developed in this thesis.

\section{Order of Presentation}

The range of results has grown greatly over the course of this thesis. The
different areas in which results are worked out are all dedicated to the
research problems explained in \autoref{sub:problems}. The areas in which
results are provided are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \item Proposition for an  open source technology stack to fully build and
  deploy a \og{} driven by \mss{}
  \item MicroNet as a reference implementation of a \ms{} \og{} development and
  operation framework using the proposed technology stack
  \item Guidelines on how to respect the \ms{} tenets in a \og{} \ms{}
  application.
  \item Validation of the usability of the framework using data gathered with an
  expert survey 
\end{itemize}

This chapter provides a detailed description of all result areas in the order
that they are listed above. Special attention will go to the explanation of
MicroNet and the concepts which are used to realize it.
