\chapter{Results}

This thesis aims to deliver results which are useful in practice and not only
of theoretical value. To make the results practically relevant a lot of effort
has been invested in the MicroNet prototype which serves as a reference
implementation for the concepts developed in this thesis.

\section{Order of Presentation}

The results are all presented together with a specific part of the MicroNet
prototype. The different areas in which results are worked out are all related
to the research problems explained in \autoref{sub:problems}. These areas are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Proposition for an  open source technology stack to fully build and
  deploy a \og{} driven by \mss{}
  \item MicroNet as a reference implementation of a \ms{} \og{} development and
  operation framework using the proposed technology stack
  \item Validation of the practicality of the framework using data gathered with
  an expert survey 
\end{itemize}
