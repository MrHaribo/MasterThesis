\section*{Abstract}

Rich \ogs{} allow thousands of player to simultaneously play together in a
persistent game world. However realizing such rich \ogs{} can be very
challenging since it forces the developer to design a distributed application
architecture to support the game. \mss{} are a modern approach to design
business applications in a distributed and therefore cloud-friendly way but
little research exists on how to apply \ms{} principles to the game domain. This
thesis introduces an overall concept on how to develop a rich \og{} using a
\ms{} application design and especially on how to deal with distribution topics
like \ms{} composition, application deployment, or data consistency. These
research subjects are examined using \gls{dsm} techniques leading to theoretical
findings which are backed by a fully functional prototype as a practical
reference implementation on how to approach \og{} development with \mss{}. The
concepts and prototypes developed during this thesis aim at simplifying \og{}
development and making it more accessible to inexperienced game developers.
