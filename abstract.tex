\section*{Abstract}

Rich \ogs{} allow thousands of players to participate in persistent game worlds
simultaneously. 


Realizing such rich \ogs{} is challenging because their developers are forced
to design distributed application architectures.

\mssuc{} are a modern approach to designing business applications in a
distributed and cloud-friendly way; little research exists on how to apply \ms{}
principles to the game domain.

This thesis introduces an overall approach how to develop a rich \og{} using a
\ms{} application design; essential distribution topics such as \ms{}
composition, application deployment, or data consistency are investigated in
depth.

These research subjects are investigated with the help of \gls{dsm}
techniques that lead to theoretical findings backed by a fully
functional open source prototype that acts as a practical reference
implementation demonstrating how to approach \og{} development with \mss{}.

The concepts and prototypes developed during this thesis aim at simplifying
\og{} development and making this field more accessible to inexperienced game
developers.
